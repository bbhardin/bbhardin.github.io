        authors: "Efimia Panagiotaki, Divya Thuremella, Jumana Baghabrah, Samuel Sze, Lanke Frank Tarimo Fu, <b>Benjamin Hardin</b>, Tyler Reinmund, Tobit Flatscher, Daniel Marques, Chris Prahacs, Lars Kunze, and Daniele De Martini",
        conference: "IROS 2025",
        abstract: "The Oxford RobotCycle Project is a novel initiative aiming to understand how road and traffic infrastructure " +
            "influence road users’ behavior, affecting cyclists’ journeys and safety. By leveraging state-of-the-art technology " +
            "and methods used in autonomous vehicles (AVs), this project introduces a novel multimodal dataset, capturing dynamic " +
            "cycling data in complex and diverse urban traffic environments. The dataset consists of range, visual, and inertial sensors, " +
            "mounted on a backpack, and eye gaze tracking glasses, coupled with an analysis of road infrastructure and interactions with " +
            "other road users. Enhanced by annotated maps, reconstructed 3-D point clouds, and a detailed ontology capturing static and " +
            "dynamic agents and their relations, the dataset provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and understanding traffic " +
            "dynamics. Heatmaps derived from the cyclists’ vision reveal attention patterns and focal points during various traffic scenarios. " +
            "We also analyze traffic interactions and risk, either perceived or actual, and correlate them with road infrastructure and traffic " +
            "volumes. To complement the dataset, we also provide a complete set of tools for risk and traffic analysis, visualization, automatic " +
            "calibration, and data annotation. The dataset can also be used to evaluate the robustness of odometry estimation methods, due to " +
            "the highly dynamic cyclist movements. Combining multimodal data with traffic and risk analysis, the Oxford RobotCycle Project " +
            "facilitates identifying safety-critical scenarios to derive actionable insights for safer, cyclist-friendly road design. " +
            "This work contributes toward improving cycling safety, enhancing urban mobility, and supporting sustainable transportation " +

        authors: "Yandika Sirgabsou, <b>Benjamin Hardin</b>, François Leblanc, Efi Raili, Pericle Salvini, David Jackson, Marina Jirotka, and Lars Kunze",
        conference: "",
        abstract: "This paper addresses the critical issue of psychological safety in the design and operation of autonomous " +
            "vehicles, which are increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence technologies. While traditional safety " +
            "standards focus primarily on physical safety, this paper emphasizes the psychological implications that arise " +
            "from human interactions with autonomous vehicles, highlighting the importance of trust and perceived risk as " +
            "significant factors influencing user acceptance. Through a review of existing safety techniques, the paper " +
            "defines psychological safety in the context of autonomous vehicles, proposes a risk model to identify and " +
            "assess psychological risks, and adopts a system-theoretic analysis method. The paper illustrates the potential " +
            "psychological hazards using a scenario involving a family's experience with an autonomous vehicle, aiming to " +
            "systematically evaluate situations that could lead to psychological harm. By establishing a framework that " +
            "incorporates psychological safety alongside physical safety, the paper contributes to the broader discourse " +
            "on the safe deployment of autonomous vehicle and aims to guide future developments in user-cantered design and " +

        title: "Safety assurance challenges for autonomous drones in Underground Mining Environments",
        authors: "Philippa Ryan, Arjun Badyal, Samuel Sze, <b>Benjamin Hardin</b>, Hasan Bin Firoz, Paulina Lewinska, and Victoria Hodge",
        conference: "TAROS 2024 (25th Annual Conference Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems)",
        abstract: "Autonomous drones have been proposed for many industrial inspection roles including building infrastructure, nuclear plants and mining. They have the benefit of accessing hazardous locations, without exposing human operators and other personnel to physical risk. Underground mines are extremely challenging for autonomous drones as there is limited infrastructure for Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), for the drone to navigate. For example, there is no Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), poor lighting, and few distinguishing landmarks. Additionally, the physical environment is extremely harsh, affecting the reliability of the drone. This paper describes the impact of these challenges in designing for, and assuring, safety. We illustrate with experience from developing an autonomous Return To Home (RTH) function for an inspection drone. This is initiated when the drone suffers a communications loss whilst surveying newly excavated corridors that are unsafe for personnel. We present some of the key safety assurance challenges we faced, including design constraints and difficulties using simulations for validation and verification.",
